# AskSense: Text-to-SQL Chatbot

**AskSense** is a powerful, user-friendly Streamlit web application that enables intuitive, conversational querying of your tabular data—no SQL knowledge required. Upload your CSV files, explore your data, and get SQL-generated answers instantly.

## 🚀 Features

- **Upload Multiple CSVs**: Each file instantly becomes a SQL table.
- **Automatic Schema Extraction**: Columns and types are detected and clearly presented.
- **Conversational Data Analysis**: Ask natural language questions and receive answers with the generated SQL!
- **View and Edit SQL**: Every SQL generated is shown transparently, with in-app editing and live preview of results.
- **AI-Powered SQL Generation**: Custom-trained model (`text2sql_model_m3_v4_anti_hallucination`) reduces "hallucinations" and produces more accurate queries.
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages for SQL or schema errors, with guidance when questions reference unavailable tables or data.
- **Modern, Customizable UI**: Slick interface with dark/light modes and easy styling using CSS.
